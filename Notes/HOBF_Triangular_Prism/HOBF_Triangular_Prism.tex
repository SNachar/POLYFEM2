For this work, we choose the lagrange shape functions for triangles. The values and gradient equations for the linear basis functions on the reference triangle are given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::reftri_quad_basis_vals}
\begin{aligned}
b_1(x,y) \, =& \, (1-x-y) \\
b_2(x,y) \, =& \, x \\
b_3(x,y) \, =& \, y
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::reftri_quad_basis_grads}
\begin{aligned}
\vec{\nabla}& b_1(x,y) \, = \, \left[ -1 , -1   \right] \\
\vec{\nabla}& b_2(x,y) \, = \, \left[ -1, 0   \right] \\
\vec{\nabla}& b_3(x,y) \, = \, \left[ 0, -1   \right]
