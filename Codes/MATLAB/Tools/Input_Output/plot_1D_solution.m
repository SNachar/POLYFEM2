%   Title:          Plot 1D Solution

%
%   Description:    MATLAB function to plot scalar solutions in 1D.
%                   
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Notes:          We use the quadrature points as additional interpolation
%                   points besides the solution nodes. This acts to make the 1D
%                   solution plot 'smoother' for higher order problems.
%
%                   This has been so far tested out to an FEM order of k=16 for
%                   a Reed problem that is highly diffusive and using MIP DSA.
%                   Eventually, depending on the quadrature set used, imaginary
%                   solutions begin to appear or the solution fails to converge.
