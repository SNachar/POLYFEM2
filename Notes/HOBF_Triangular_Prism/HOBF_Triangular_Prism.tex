For this work, we choose the standard quadratic shape functions for triangles. The value and gradient equations for the basis functions on the reference triangle are given in Eq. (\ref{eq::basis_vals}).

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		b_1(s,t) \, =& \, (1-s-t) (1-2s-2t),  &\vec{\nabla}& b_1(s,t) \, = \, \left( 4(s+t)-1 , 4(s+t)-1   \right) \\
		b_2(s,t) \, =& \, 2s(s-1/2),             &\vec{\nabla}& b_2(s,t) \, = \, \left( 4s-1, 0   \right) \\
		b_3(s,t) \, =& \, 2t(t-1/2),              &\vec{\nabla}& b_3(s,t) \, = \, \left( 0, 4t-1   \right) \\
		b_4(s,t) \, =& \, 4s (1-s-t),             &\vec{\nabla}& b_4(s,t) \, = \, \left( 4-8s, -4s   \right) \\
		b_5(s,t) \, =& \, 4st,                       &\vec{\nabla}& b_5(s,t) \, = \, \left( 4t, 4s   \right) \\
		b_6(s,t) \, =& \, 4t (1-s-t),             &\vec{\nabla}& b_6(s,t) \, = \, \left( -4t, 4-8t   \right)
